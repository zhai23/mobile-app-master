/// We use Flutter's localization to tell us which locale should be loaded.
/// This class is pretty standard way to include custom localization:
/// https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#adding-your-own-localized-messages
/// What is new is [Localization] class that loads correct `.json` file and
/// [ModelGenerator] that validates `.json` files and generates statically typed
/// model based on their structure.
///
/// NOTE:
/// `.json` files are compared by their language code only! That means only
/// `en.json` is supported, don't use `en-US.json`. If you wish to support
/// country codes at one point, update this class.
///
